      <h2>Personal data</h2>
      <p>
        Quick Anki uses names of user's Anki decks to let them choose which
        decks to add a new card to. At the moment no personal data is sent
        anywhere. In the future, we may collect clicks for statistics in which
        case the privacy policy will be updated.
      </p>

      <h2>Third party services</h2>
      <p>
        Quick Anki uses Chrome (Chromium) and browser's Web Storage API
        (localStorage) for storing user's chosen decks so that they don't have
        to choose it every time they reload a page.
      </p>

      <h2>The website</h2>
      <p>
        At the moment, this website doesn't collect or send any personal data
        but may do so in the future in which case the privacy policy will be
        updated.
